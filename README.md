# Express.js Route Handler Missing Error Handling for Invalid User IDs

This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js route handlers:  lack of error handling for invalid input.  Specifically, the code attempts to parse a user ID from the request parameters as an integer without checking if it's actually a number. This can lead to unexpected behavior or crashes if a non-numeric ID is provided.

## Bug

The `bug.js` file contains the buggy code.  The route handler for `/users/:id` attempts to find a user based on the ID passed in the URL. However, it doesn't handle cases where the ID is not a valid integer, leading to potential errors.

## Solution

The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected version of the code. This version includes comprehensive error handling to gracefully manage invalid user IDs.
